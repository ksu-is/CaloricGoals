# CaloricNecklaceTracker
I would like for this wearable technology to track the goals of an individual and would like to start with an application to 
allow the user understand their goal as well as display the caloric intake in order to achieve this goal healthy and efficent. 

## Goal Setting Application
The application is made simple for the user to understand. I want to create an interface that will display a quick series of questions to allow the user
to completly take grasp of their goals. The following questions will be asked: 

   - What is your weight in LBS
   - What is your goal?
       -Maintain weight
       -Lose weight
       -Gain Muscle
       
 After user input, 
 The application will quickly display the Users needed caloric intake in order to achieve the goal provided. 
 
 ### Customer Service is priority 
 One thing I want to focus when looking at the end-user is for them to feel completly satisfied and cofident they can trust this tool. 
 The top priority for this is to create a comforting envionrment for them to discuss their weight, goals, and accomplishment along the way!
